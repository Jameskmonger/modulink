# modulink

Locally link a module so that it can be tested with ease.

## Usage

`modulink` can either be installed locally to your package or globally to the machine.

I recommend installing it locally, because then it will be installed for users with the `npm install` command.

### Local

To install `modulink` locally, run the following command:

    npm install --save-dev modulink

(as `modulink` is primarily used for testing, it should be saved as a developer dependency rather than a user one).
